0.1.4

- Added ranges support for lc-node-do's -i arg, i.e.
  if previosuly to remove nodes with ids like
  1001, 1002, 1003 you had to issue command like:

     for node in 1001 1002 1003; do \
          lc-node-do -i ${node} destroy; done

  now you just do: lc-node-do -i 1001,1002,1003 destroy
  or even: lc-node-do -i 1001-1003 destroy

- Refuse to work if config file permissons are loose
